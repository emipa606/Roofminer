--- Original Description ---
A designator for mining a connected set of mountain tiles that share a roof type (unroofed, constructed, thin rock, overhead mountain, etc).

The primary purpose is to mine tunnels and rooms in mountains that won't trigger infestations.

Thanks to Toasteh and Ogliss and the previous developers of Veinminer which this mod is based on.</description>
